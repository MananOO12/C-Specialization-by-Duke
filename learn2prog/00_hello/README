This assignment is a walkthrough for you to use
emacs, git, and the grading system.  Your goal
is to create a file called "hello.txt" with one line
in it, that says

hello



(1) Use emacs to open/create a file called hello.txt
     o Type C-x C-f (Control x, then Control f) [which opens
       a new file]
     o type hello.txt  [then hit enter]
     o Split the screen (C-x 2) and then change one half to
       show this buffer (C-x b , should say default: README, if so hit
       Enter. If not, type README, then hit Enter). Then use
       "C-x o" to move back into the hello.txt buffer.
(2) Write one line, that says hello [then hit enter---we generally
end files with a newline]
(3) Save the file: C-x C-s
(4) Add/commit/push it to git
       Suspend emacs with C-z  then run the following commands
         git add hello.txt
	 git commit -m "Did assignment 0"
	 git push
	 fg
       The last of these will bring emacs back
	   
(5) Grade the assignment, get your feedback (and the next assignment)
  Suspend emacs (C-z)
     grade
     git pull
     fg

(6) Now, open up your grade.txt file in emacs (C-x C-f grade.txt)
    so you can read your feedback.  Don't forget that you can
    change back to this buffer with C-x b, and/or split the screen
    with C-x 2
    When you are done, you can quit Emacs with C-x C-c.

(7) Did something go wrong?  If so, fix it, and add/push/commit/grade
    again.  If everything went right, you should have your gotten
    your next assignment when you did git pull. After you quit emacs,
    cd to that directory:
      cd ../01_apple
    and open the README there in emacs.  Follow its instructions!
